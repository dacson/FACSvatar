# Getting Started with Crossbar.io

This repository provides Docker containers that allow an easy start into developing applications which are connected by Crossbar.io.

These allow you to spin up a Crossbar.io instance and as many containers across the three languages that the Crossbar.io project itself supports (Python, JavaScript - browser + NodeJS, C++) which all interact with each other.

Instructions for how to use this are in the [Crossbar.io Getting Started documentation](http://crossbar.io/docs/Getting-Started/).
